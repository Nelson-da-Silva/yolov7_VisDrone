# Object Detection from Drones using a Fisheye Lens Camera

GitHub repository associated with the dissertation of Nelson da Silva's final year Master's project completed at the Imperial College London for the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Electronic and Information Engineering.

This project augments the existing VisDrone dataset so as to make it look like it's been captured through a fisheye lens.

## Data Augmentation
The fisheye projection model chosen for this project can be applied to existing datasets using the scripts found in distortion_scripts/. The function to apply the considered radial distortion model is included in apply-fisheye.py for user interest but is not used.

## Datasets
To access the datasets used in this project, simply run the scripts found in the get_datasets/ directory.
